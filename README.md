This code computes the isostables of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model (cases of real and complex eigenvalues), using forward integration. It runs in about 2 minutes on a standard computer.
The code can be easily adapted to other models with a stable fixed point. The method also works with models of higher dimensions.

The method is based on the results presented in "A. Mauroy, I. Mezic, and J. Moehlis, Isostables, isochrons, and Koopman spectrum for the action-angle reduction of stable fixed point dynamics, Physica D, vol. 261, pp. 19-30, 2013"
